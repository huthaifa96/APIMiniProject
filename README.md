# Endless Medical API

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to create a test framework for a medical service. By working in pairs, we hope to to incorporate good collaboration using GitHub, follow the scrum model by holding regular stand-ups and reviews and work closely together to carry out tests for the service.

By the end of this sprint, I aim to find a number of free API's and choose the API most appropriate for this project.

#### Sprint Goals

- [ ] Complete user story 1.1
- [ ] Complete user story 1.2
- [ ] Agile Documentation

#### Sprint Review

The main purpose of the first sprint was to find the most appropriate API that can be used for this project. So, the API had to allow us to call, get and post requests whilst also being free. After looking at many options, the Endless Medical API was chosen. It will allow us to perform all the necessary request that is needed to fulfil the project requirements.

#### Sprint Retrospective

The search took longer than expected as we struggled to find a free API and some of the ones that were found, didn't suit our requirements. Therefore, tasks such as setting up GitHub, couldn't be completed in this sprint. This has to be performed in sprint 2 along with the other unfinished user stories.

### Sprint 2

The aim of this sprint, is to complete the project so completing all the remaining user stories.

#### Sprint Goals

- [ ] Complete user story 2
- [ ] Complete user story 3.1
- [ ] Complete user story 3.2
- [ ] Complete user story 4.1
- [ ] Complete user story 4.2
- [ ] Complete user story 4.3
- [ ] Complete user story 4.4

#### Sprint Review
We began this sprint by setting up our GitHub repository - the relevant collaborators were invited and the project board was set up. The framework to set up the API and the tests to ensure the new session is created were also set up. However, three user stories could not be completed in this sprint, so another sprint is needed in order to complete the remaining tasks.

#### Sprint Retrospective
Not all the tasks could be completed in this sprint and this was mainly down to having gaps in our knowledge regarding some test areas so a review of the lesson was needed. Also, some user stories took longer than expected so this will help us plan sprint three better as we now have a better idea how long certain procedures could take.

### Sprint 3

The aim of this sprint is to complete the remaining user stories from sprint two.

#### Sprint Goals

- [ ] Complete user story 3.2
- [ ] Complete user story 4.2
- [ ] Complete user story 4.3

#### Sprint Review
This was an unplanned sprint designed to complete the uncompleted tasks from sprint two. This was done successfully and all the tests have passed.

#### Sprint Retrospective
All the tasks for this sprint was completed successfully with no remaining user stories.

### Project Review

The project requirements were met so this project can be considered successful. By making get and post requests on postman first, it made it much easier to create the framework. This was the first non-individual coding project for the both of us and this helped us appreciate the collaborating features of GitHub as this is the first time we have used it in this way. Also, working in the SCRUM framework helped us stay organised despite the setbacks and this can be seen from the recorded documentation in the project board.

### Project Retrospective

As this is the first group/team project of the course, a lot of lessons can be taken. Firstly, when delegating tasks, the tasks should not clash if possible - partner 1 shouldn't have to wait for partner 2 to finish as this can effect productivity. On the subject of productivity, each task should've been timeboxed because this would help in planning future sprints as you'd know roughly how long each task will realistically take. This would have helped us as we felt that we ran out of time near the end to carry out more tests.

We also tried planning out all the tests before having a solid understanding of how API's operated. We lost some time because of this as we realised some of the planned tests weren't possible or were too complicated for us to do. So in future, incorporating a review session of the material covered in class  would help us in doing things quicker as we would have a better understanding from the beginning.
